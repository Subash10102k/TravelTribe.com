## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
This application is built using the following technologies:

- JavaScript: a programming language used to add interactivity to the website
- Node.js: a JavaScript runtime environment
- HTML/CSS: markup languages used to create the structure and style of the website 
- MongoDB Atlas : a cloud-based database service

### Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following software installed on your computer:

- Node.js
- Create an account on the MongoDB Atlas
- Vs code.


---
### Set up your environment:
Ensure that your development environment is properly configured for each of the technologies you'll be using. This includes installing Node.js .

### Build your backend: 
Start by building your backend with java script and MongoDb atlas. Test them to ensure they're functioning correctly.

### Build your frontend: 
Next, create HBS for each places that you want to display in your website (Handlebars) is a popular templating engine for Node.js web applications. It is used to generate dynamic HTML pages by combining static HTML templates with dynamic data and javaScript .install the necessary dependencies and  Create your components and define your UI, making sure to connect to your backend APIs.

### Test locally: 
Test your application locally to make sure everything is working as expected. This involves running both your frontend and backend, making sure they're properly communicating with each other.

### Installing 
Install Node.js: 
- You can download and install node.js from the official website. Follow the instructions for your operating system to complete the installation process.

Create a database: 
- Once after creating an account on the mongodb atlas  create a database for your travel tribe. You can use  a GUI tool like MongoDB compass to create a new database.

Install VS Code: 
- You can download and install Spring Boot from the official website. Follow the instructions for your operating system to complete the installation process.

Connect to MongoDB Atlas: 
- Configure your application to connect to the MongoDB Atlas database you created earlier. You can use java Script to handle the database connectivity and it can be tested MOngoDB Compass.
